                    <p class="text-secondary">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which
                         is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. Two players from the
                          batting team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket, with one player from the fielding team (the bowler) 
                          bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball 
                          and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each exchange. Runs are also scored when 
                          the ball reaches or crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.</p>

        <h2>Cricket</h2>
        <P>Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement; others 
            include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball games category,
             golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis. In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target
              structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend.
               The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven
                to and from between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole);
                 and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it"</P>

                Its success was underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting. Cricket was prominent in London as early 
                as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury.</p>
